    "- üì° **Station Management**: Setting up monitoring stations with sensors\n",
    "- üìä **Data Management**: Uploading sensor data and measurements\n",
    "- üìà **Data Retrieval**: Querying and analyzing uploaded data\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authentication and client initialization\n",
    "- Campaign creation and management\n",
